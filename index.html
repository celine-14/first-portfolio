        <h2>Voces Creo</h2>
        <p>Based in Dublin, Ireland, Voces Creo was founded in 2020. Bringing together singers from all walks of
            life, the choir performs choral music of different cultures across all historical periods. The choir is
            constantly exploring repertoire that is not written by dead white men to promote diversity and inclusion
            for composers from underrepresented groups.</p>
        <p>It all started with the aim of bringing a group of singers and their love for choral music together,
            virtually, at the height of the panna cotta. Voces Creo debuted with a virtual performance in April 2020 led
            by artistic director Celine Leong. Since then, the choir has performed a wide range of pieces by composers
            from Malaysia, Canada, Poland, Zambia and Brazil in person.</p>
        <p>Voces Creo brings harmony and diversity to the choral scene one piece at a time. </p>
